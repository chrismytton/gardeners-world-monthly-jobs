    <h1>Gardener's World monthly jobs API</h1>

    <h2><a href="jobs.json">jobs.json</a></h2>

    <p>API of what to do in the garden.</p>
    <p>The API returns an object
    where the keys are the month names, <code>January</code> through to
    <code>December</code>. Each key returns an object with 3 keys,
    <code>Flowers</code>, <code>Fruit and veg</code>, <code>Greenhouse</code>
    and <code>Garden maintenance</code> which correspond to different areas of
    the garden. These keys returns arrays of strings. Each string is a single
    job that needs doing in the current month for the corresponding area of the
    garden. </p>
